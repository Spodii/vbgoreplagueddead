Plagued Dead was a game originally being made for vbGORE, but was abandoned due to it's creator starting up a new engine (NetGore). The code was left available since it included many features that expanded on the base engine, vbGORE.

This project is long dead, but it remains as it provides valuable resources for vbGORE projects, and can be used as a base for a new vbGORE game.
