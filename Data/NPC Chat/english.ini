ASK 3 The |Reaver| uses brute force to destroy their foes. Using powerful melee weapons, they can smash their enemies, throw them around, scare them, knock them out and even make them bleed to death. Reavers use their |rage| as their primary weapon. As they fight and kill more, their rage will increase. They can either hold onto this rage to help increase damage or unleash it in a high concentration to inflict immensive damage in a variety of forms. Reavers act best against large groups of enemies. Being pinned down will only bring out the worst in them./r/rReavers have very high health and defense, making them easier than other professions to control. The life of a Reaver is full of constant intense fighting with little resting.

ASK 4 The |Infiltrator| is the master of stealth and disguise. They use the shadows to hide from their enemiesk, exposing themselves only to unleash very powerful, deadly attacks. Although they can sometimes be lucky enough to get away, if cornered and trapped, the Infiltrator has very minimal chance of surviving. Using grappling hooks and baits, the Infiltrator can lure their away from large groups to pick them off one by one./r/rThe Infiltrator must be able to predict the enemy's movement and never get cornered since they can not take a great amount of damage. Although some of the greatest achievements have been made by Infiltrators, they unfortunately are the most commonly killed.

ASK 5 The |Engineer| is a very intelligent and resourceful scavanger. They are some of the few left who are able to use and control highly complicated machinery - primarely robots. The Engineer spends his life learning how to use these machines and milk the most potential out of them which prevents them from becoming strong physically. Because of this, the more bulky and advanced weaponry are beyond their usage. But this is no concern for them. The Engineer can control an army of robot drones that will do their bidding. A skilled Engineer can create an army of powerful drones optimal for their enemy. To control these drones, and their armor, the Engineer relies primarely on their energy supply. It takes energy to repair drones, run them, and to hold up their suits of armor. /r/rThe Engineer is by far the weakest physically, but make up for this with their advanced armor suits. These armor suits greatly decrease their speed, though, making them easy to gang up on. The Engineer has to figure out the weaknesses of their enemies, along with the best combination of drones for optimal performance.

ASK 6 The |Squad Leader| is not very powerful themselves, but make up for it in how powerful they can make their teammates. With intensive training in medicine and drugs, the Squad Leader can heal and enhance themselves and their allies to powers far beyond their original. They don't only use these drugs for enhancing their allies, though. These drugs can be used to destroy the body of their enemies, weakening and immobilizing them. Enhancing their allies is not the only way they support them, though. Highly trained Squad Leaders can even bring their allies back to life and make hologram images of themselves to distract their enemies blows./r/rSquad Leaders have high health and defense, making them very sustainable to damage, but without the support of allies most of their abilities go to waste.
